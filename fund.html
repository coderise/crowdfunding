						<h2 class="major">What is Coderise?</h2>
						<p><a href="http://coderise.org">Coderise.org</a> is a non profit that empowers kids in developing nations by teaching them how to code.  This opens them to a wealth of opportunities for upward social mobility that they would otherwise not have in their country.</p>
						<p>Often in developing countries upward social mobility depends on being born to the right family, having the right skin color, going to the right private schools in the right city.  When a child is able to participate in the global economy as valuable contributor to the digital revolution, many of the local historical barriers to personal development are removed. Coderise enables that.</p>

						<h2 class="major">How can I Help?</h2>
						<p>Even though kids in cities all over the developing world want Coderise to happen in their community, our biggest obstacle is access to computers.</p>
						<p>So far, we've been lucky enough to count with a few partners that give us access to their computer labs on weekends and after school during weekdays. However, it is often very difficult for universities, companies and government sponsored computer labs to have staff stay after hours and come on weekends to open and close the labs, this has made it very difficult for us to execute more programs and reach more kids.</p>
						<p>Here is where your come in, with your help, Coderise.org can buy its own computers and take the program when and where the kids need them.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Our History & Testimonials</h2>
						<p>Almost 4 years ago, thanks to your support on Indiegogo, we raised enough funding to get the organization off the ground. Today, we have successfully completed 5 programs, in 3 cities reaching more than 95 kids.</p>
						<p>In our free 9 week program, they learn the basics of computer science with javascript, html and CSS and in the second half of the program, students learn how to build products by solving problems that either they face or those of their community. Each weekend we bring role models that are either successful engineers and/or tech entrepreneurs to share their experiences. The program ends with a demo day with parents, peers, journalists and entrepreneurs.</p>
						<p>If we exceed the goal, we will also be able to cover food and transportation for more students as we take the program to more cities.</p>
